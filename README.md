My homelab Kubernetes cluster in declarative state. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) automatically deploys any changes to the `/cluster` directory.

- [Thanks](#thanks)

## Architecture

The cluster runs on a single [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) node running in a [k3os](https://github.com/rancher/k3os) VM on a single [Proxmox](https://pve.proxmox.com/) host. I'm currently running the entire cluster on my previous desktop machine.

### Virtual Hosts

- k3s (VM)
- NFS fileserver (VM)
- Caddy (LXC)

### Hardware

- 4x12TB HDD
- 32GB DDR4 2400MHz RAM
- Intel i7 6700k
- Nvidia 1070
- HUSBZB-1 Zigbee + Z-Wave Adapter
- Arduino Uno + WS2812B LED strip

### Networking

1. This cluster uses the default Traefik ingress controller deployed by k3s to configure hostnames using a subdomain of my registered tld.
1. Then Caddy (a build with the [Cloudflare module](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare) included) uses LetsEncrypt to provide certificates for all my services without exposing any ports on my router to the public internet.
1. I then map each hostname to the Caddy server in my DNS server (Pi-hole).

#### Repository Structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore

```
cluster
├── apps
│   ├── default
│   ├── networking
│   └── system-upgrade
├── base
│   └── flux-system
├── core
│   ├── cert-manager
│   ├── metallb-system
│   ├── namespaces
│   └── system-upgrade
└── crds
    └── cert-manager
```

As well as the following directories under `server` which is used to provision the infrastructure on the Proxmox host.

- **packer** directory contains Packer configs for used to build the custom Proxmox template images
- **terraform** directory contains Terraform templates used to deploy the infrastructure to Proxmox
- **ansible** directory contains Ansible playbooks for configuring the machines once deployed

```

│   ├── playbooks
│   └── requirements.yaml
├── packer
│   ├── images
│   └── templates
└── terraform
    └── proxmox
```

### Storage

I provisioned Proxmox using the ZFS filesystem which provides many benefits including redundancy and snapshots. My current RAID configuration (mirror vdevs, roughly RAID 10) offers 1/2 of my total storage capacity.

Storage for the k3s cluster is provided by the virtualized NFS server. The [NFS Subdirectory External Provisioner Helm chart](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/) is used to provision persistent volume claims automatically.

## Installation

The below steps will provision the k3s cluster as well as a reverse proxy and a fileserver.

### Tools

These tools should be installed on the machine you'll be managing the cluster from.

### Prerequisites

- You must have a server with Proxmox VE installed
    - Must use ZFS for storage
    - Must have sufficient storage space (I use RAID10 with 4x12tb drives)
- You must have a public/private ssh key-pair generated and added to ssh agent
    ```bash
    # Generate key
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    # Add to ssh agent (you may need to enable the agent separately)
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```
- You must have the SOPS GPG private key imported
- Install the `pre-commit` hooks to ensure linting runs on every commit as well as to ensure unencrypted secrets are not committed
    ```bash
    pre-commit install-hooks
    ```
- Install Ansible dependencies
    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
    ```

### Provisioning cluster

1. Create a user in Proxmox for terraform
    ```bash
    pveum user add terraform@pve --password (the proxmox terraform user password)
    pveum aclmod / -user terraform@pve -role Administrator
    ```
1. Download the required debian LXC template
    ```bash
    pveam download local debian-11-standard_11.0-1_amd64.tar.gz
    ```
1. Double check the [packer config](./server/packer/variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl) and [terraform config](./server/terraform/proxmox/variables.auto.tfvars) then add your secrets to the secrets files
    ```bash
    echo "proxmox_password = \"YOUR PASSWORD HERE\"" >> server/packer/images/secrets.auto.pkrvars.hcl
    echo "proxmox_password = \"your-domain.com\"" >> server/packer/images/secrets.auto.pkrvars.hcl
    echo "proxmox_password = \"YOUR PASSWORD HERE\"" >> server/terraform/proxmox/secrets.auto.tfvars
    echo "cloudflare_token = \"YOUR TOKEN HERE\"" >> server/terraform/proxmox/secrets.auto.tfvars
    ```
1. Build the template images
    ```bash
    packer build server/packer/images
    ```
1. Check the terraform plan and apply it
    ```bash
    terraform -chdir=server/terraform/proxmox init
    terraform -chdir=server/terraform/proxmox plan
    terraform -chdir=server/terraform/proxmox apply
    ```
1. Once everything's deployed, add local DNS records for the service hostnames from the [Caddy config](./server/ansible/playbooks/proxy/caddy.yaml) and point them all to the proxy server's address

1. Add the USB devices to the master node
    ```
    update VM 107: -usb0 host=10c4:8a2a
    update VM 107: -usb1 host=534d:2109
    update VM 107: -usb2 host=1a86:7523
    ```

## Thanks

This cluster has been heavily inspired by the [k8s@home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home) community. Thank you to everyone that contributes there as well as to the authors of the open source technologies which operate this cluster.
